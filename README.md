# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview:
Bitcoin currently has a prohibitvely expensive cost of entry for investors.  This exercise reviews data for other coins to see which coins valued lower might have promising trends for an investment firm to consider investing in.

The raw data provided was manually preprocessed for PCA, clustered using K-means, and visualized using HVplot.
